# üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà Pride Flag API

[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/JoeHart/pride-flag-color-api) [Browse the Flags](https://pride-flag.dev/flags)

This is an API to list data about various LGBTQA+ Pride Flags, delivered as JSON by REST or GraphQL. This isn't an exhaustive list, it's just ones I've added for now. If there are any missing let me know or open a Pull Request üòÑ

## Using the API

Feel free to use this API for demos and fun things, I'd avoid using it for anything important üòÖ.

### GraphQL

Primarily this is meant to be a GraphQL API. You can send GraphQL queries from your GraphQL Client to the following endpoint:

```
https://pride-flag.dev/api/graphql
```

You can view the schema and play with some queries at the [GraphQL Playground](https://pride-flag.dev/api/graphql).

Example Query:

```GraphQL
query {
  flag(id: "transgender_1999") {
    id
    name
    year
    colors{
      name
      r
      g
      b
    }
    svgBase64
  }
}

```

Example Response:

```JSON
{
  "data": {
    "flag": {
      "id": "transgender_1999",
      "name": "Transgender",
      "year": "1999",
      "colors": [
        {
          "name": "light blue",
          "r": 91,
          "g": 206,
          "b": 250
        },
        {
          "name": "pink",
          "r": 245,
          "g": 169,
          "b": 184
        },
        {
          "name": "white",
          "r": 255,
          "g": 255,
          "b": 255
        }
      ],
      "svgBase64": "data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCA4MDAgNDgwIj48cGF0aCBmaWxsPSIjNUJDRUZBIiBkPSJNMCAwaDgwMHY0ODBIMHoiPjwvcGF0aD48cGF0aCBmaWxsPSIjRjVBOUI4IiBkPSJNMCA5Nmg4MDB2Mjg4SDB6Ij48L3BhdGg+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI0ZGRiIgZD0iTTAgMTkyaDgwMHY5NkgweiI+PC9wYXRoPjwvc3ZnPg=="

## Why have you built this?

I started this in Pride Month 2020, trapped inside due to Corona and thought I'd celebrate Pride by making an API instead of going to the parade.

And I also wanted a fun API to use in side-projects/talks/workshops.

Plus I noticed the domain `pride.dev` was still available and thought it was just too cool not to do something with it.
